Modified to work with Thrift 0.9.3 and the latest gRPC 1.0 (Golang)

### Simple Thrift and gRPC performance test

use a simple "helloworld" prototype to test thrift and gRPC.
All servers and clients are implemented by Golang, Java And Scala

Test result as follows (milliseconds/10000 calls). The first value is using one client to test servers and the second value is using 20 clients to test concurrently.

|  | Golang | Java | Scala |
